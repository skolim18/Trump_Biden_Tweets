# Trump_Biden_Tweets
Sentimental analysis of Trump's and Biden's Tweets

Purpose of this project was to create an analysis of tweets from US presidential campaign. 
I visualized most commonly used words by each of the candidate and also made a sentimental analysis of sentences.
It turned out that tweets written by Trump were more negative than Biden ones.

In this project I used techniques such as removing stopwords, cleaning text, lemmatization, removing emojis, 
stemming, data viz with Matplotlib library and sentimental analysis with Textblob library.
